## Introduction
The Snake Game is a console-based implementation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer without running into the walls or itself. The game is built purely in C and runs in the terminal/command prompt.

## Features
- Simple controls: Navigate the snake using the arrow keys.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of your score based on how much food the snake eats.
- Game Over detection: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- Adjustable speed: Modify the speed of the snake for different levels of difficulty.

## Installation
To run the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

bash
Sao chép mã
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game

2. Compile the code:

Use IDE code::block to build and run with console application. 

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the direction of the snake.
- The goal is to eat the food (*) that appears randomly on the screen.
- Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or itself.
